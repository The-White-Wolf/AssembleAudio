# SS32-WAV-Conversion

## About

The core purpose of this program is to convert regular audio files to a specific 'SCOT' format, and to also edit the resulting 'SCOT' audio files.
The 'SCOT' formatted file is then sent over the network, usually to a dispatch server that handles the scheduling of the audio files.
The program is intended to be a replacement for TLC (Trim, Label, Convert), which is the
program SCOTT STUDIOS provides to manipulate 'SCOT' files.

The interface for this program is build using [Kivy](https://kivy.org "Kivy Homepage").
