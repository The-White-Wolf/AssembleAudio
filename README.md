# SS32-WAV-Conversion
Extremely early version of a program that adds SS32 headers to a WAV file to make it compatible with SS32 software.

Intended as a pseudo replacement for TLC (Trim, Convert, Label) that is used for Scott Studios SS32 software.
Currently, the software can convert WAV files (though the implementation is primitive).

The interface is built using Kivy (https://kivy.org/).
